Hello!

For a static view of our run of the notebook see sampling.html.
If you wanna try different values of the notebook run the interactive version of it.
Before running the notebook we suggest you install the necessary packages:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

We wrote a small, simple CLI to run the algorithm. To use it please run:
    python query.py
    
Thank you!
